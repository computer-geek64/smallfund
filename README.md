# SmallFund: Powering Small Businesses to Make the Most of their Returns

#SmallFund is a platform that allows small businesses to advertise their returned products and increase their chances of making profit on a sold item. A huge problem that small businesses face is not being able to resale returned products which leads to loss of profits and heavy wastage of goods. Using our platform, small businesses will be able to upload pictures of their refunded items with a small description and wholesale them to the public for the chance to make a profit.
